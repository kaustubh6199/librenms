Introduction
------------

LibreNMS is an autodiscovering PHP/MySQL/SNMP based network monitoring
which includes support for a wide range of network hardware and operating
systems including Cisco, Linux, FreeBSD, Juniper, Brocade, Foundry, HP and
many more.

LibreNMS is a community-based fork of the last GPL-licensed version of
Observium <http://observium.org/>.  LibreNMS intends to be a viable network
monitoring project and community that:
- encourages contribution,
- focuses on the needs of its users, and
- offers a welcoming, friendly environment for everyone.

The Debian Social Contract <http://www.debian.org/social_contract> will be
the basis of our priority system, and mutual respect the basis of our
behaviour towards others.
