# Templates

> This page is for installs running version 1.41 or later. You can find the older docs [here](Old_Templates.md)

Templates can be assigned to a single or a group of rules and can contain any kind of text. There is also a default template which is used for any rule that isn't associated with a template. This template can be found under `Alert Templates` page and can be edited. It also has an option revert it back to its default content. 

The templating engine in use is Laravel Blade. We will cover some of the basics here, however the official Laravel docs will have more information [here](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/blade) 

## Syntax

Controls:

- if-else (Else can be omitted):
`@if ($placeholder  == value)Some Text @else Other Text @endif`
- foreach-loop:
`@foreach ($faults as $key => $value) Key: $key<br/>Value: $value @endforeach`

Placeholders:

Placeholders are special variables that if used within the template will be replaced with the relevant data, I.e:

`The device {{ $hostname }} has been up for {{ $uptime }} seconds` would result in the following `The device localhost has been up for 30344 seconds`.

> When using placeholders to echo data, you need to wrap the palceholder in `{{ }}`. I.e `{{ $hostname }}`.

- Device ID: `$device_id`
- Hostname of the Device: `$hostname`
- sysName of the Device: `$sysName`
- sysDescr of the Device: `$sysDescr`
- hardware of the Device: `$hardware`
- Software version of the Device: `$version` 
- location of the Device: `$location`
- uptime of the Device (in seconds): `$uptime`
- short uptime of the Device (28d 22h 30m 7s): `$uptime_short`
- long uptime of the Device (28 days, 22h 30m 7s): `$uptime_long`
- description (purpose db field) of the Device: `$description`
- notes of the Device: `$notes`
- notes of the alert: `$alert_notes`
- ping timestamp (if icmp enabled): `$ping_timestamp`
- ping loss (if icmp enabled): `$ping_loss`
- ping min (if icmp enabled): `$ping_min`
- ping max (if icmp enabled): `$ping_max`
- ping avg (if icmp enabled): `$ping_avg`
- Title for the Alert: `$title`
- Time Elapsed, Only available on recovery (`$state == 0`): `$elapsed`
- Alert-ID: `$id`
- Unique-ID: `$uid`
- Faults, Only available on alert (`$state != 0`), must be iterated in a foreach (`@foreach ($faults as $key => $value) @endforeach`). Holds all available information about the Fault, accessible in the format `$value['Column']`, for example: `$value['ifDescr']`. Special field `$value['string']` has most Identification-information (IDs, Names, Descrs) as single string, this is the equivalent of the default used.
- State: `$state`
- Severity: `$severity`
- Rule: `$rule`
- Rule-Name: `$name`
- Timestamp: `$timestamp`
- Transport name: `$transport`

- Contacts, must be iterated in a foreach, `$key` holds email and `$value` holds name: `$contacts`

Placeholders can be used within the subjects for templates as well although $faults is most likely going to be worthless.

The Default Template is a 'one-size-fit-all'. We highly recommend defining your own templates for your rules to include more specific information.

## Examples

Default Template:
```text
{{ $title }}
Severity: {{ $severity }}
@if ($state == 0)Time elapsed: {{ $elapsed }} @endif
Timestamp: {{ $timestamp }}
Unique-ID: {{ $uid }}
Rule: @if ($name) {{ $name }} @else {{ $rule }} @endif
@if ($faults) Faults:
@foreach ($faults as $key => $value)
  #{{ $key }}: {{ $value['string'] }}
@endforeach
@endif
Alert sent to:
@foreach ($contacts as $key => $value)
  {{ $value }} <{{ $key }}>
@endforeach
```
Ports Utilization Template:
```text
{{ $title }}
Device Name: {{ $hostname }}
Severity: {{ $severity }}
@if ($state == 0) Time elapsed: {{ $elapsed }} @endif
Timestamp: {{ $timestamp }}
Rule: @if ($name) {{ $name }} @else {{ $rule }} @endif
@foreach ($faults as $key => $value)
Physical Interface: $value['ifDescr']
Interface Description: $value['ifAlias']
Interface Speed: @php echo ($value['ifSpeed']/1000000000); @endphp Gbs
Inbound Utilization: @php echo (($value['ifInOctets_rate']*8)/$value['ifSpeed'])*100; @endphp%
Outbound Utilization: @php echo (($value['ifOutOctets_rate']*8)/$value['ifSpeed'])*100; @endphp%
@endforeach
```

Storage:

Features: {{ $features }}
Purpose: {{ $purpose }}
Notes: {{ $notes }}

Server: {{ $sysName }} @foreach ($faults as $key => $value)Mount Point: $value['storage_descr'] Percent Utilized: $value['storage_perc']@endforeach
```

Temperature Sensors:
```text
{{ $title }}

Device Name: {{ $hostname }}
Severity: {{ $severity }} 
Timestamp: {{ $timestamp }}
Uptime: {{ $uptime_short }}
@if ($state == 0) Time elapsed: {{ $elapsed }} @endif
Location: {{ $location }}
Description: {{ $description }}
Features: {{ $features }}
Purpose: {{ $purpose }}
Notes: {{ $notes }}

Rule: @if ($name) {{ $name }} @else {{ $rule }} @endif
@if ($faults) Faults:
@foreach ($faults as $key => $value)
#{{ $key }}: Temperature: $value['sensor_current']째C
** @php echo ($value['sensor_current']-$value['sensor_limit']); @endphp째C over limit
Previous Measurement: $value['sensor_prev']째C
High Temperature Limit: $value['sensor_limit']째C
@endforeach
 @endif
```

Value Sensors:
```text
{{ $title }}

Device Name: {{ $hostname }}
Severity: {{ $severity }} 
Timestamp: {{ $timestamp }}
Uptime: {{ $uptime_short }}
@if ($state == 0) Time elapsed: {{ $elapsed }} @endif
Location: {{ $location }}
Description: {{ $description }}
Features: {{ $features }}
Purpose: {{ $purpose }}
Notes: {{ $notes }}

Rule: @if ($name) {{ $name }} @else {{ $rule }} @endif
@if ($faults) Faults:
@foreach ($faults as $key => $value)
#{{ $key }}: Sensor {{ $value['sensor_current'] }}
** @php echo ($value['sensor_current']-$value['sensor_limit']); @endphp over limit
Previous Measurement: {{ $value['sensor_prev'] }}
Limit: {{ $value['sensor_limit'] }}
@endforeach 
@endif
```

Memory Alert:
```text
{{ $title }}

Device Name: {{ $hostname }}
Severity: {{ $severity }} 
Uptime: {{ $uptime_short }}
@if ($state == 0) Time elapsed: {{ $elapsed }} @endif
Timestamp: {{ $timestamp }}
Location: {{ $location }}
Description: {{ $description }}
Notes: {{ $notes }}

Server: {{ $hostname }} @foreach ($faults as $key => $value)
Memory Description: {{ $value['mempool_descr'] }} 
Percent Utilized: {{ $value['mempool_perc'] }} @endforeach 
```


Conditional formatting example, will display a link to the host in email or just the hostname in any other transport:
```text
@if ($transport == mail)<a href="https://my.librenms.install/device/device={{ $hostname }}/">{{ $hostname }}</a>
@else
{{ $hostname }}
@endif
```

## Examples HTML

Note: To use HTML emails you must set HTML email to Yes in the WebUI under Global Settings > Alerting Settings > Email transport > Use HTML emails

Note: To include Graphs you must enable unauthorized graphs in config.php. Allow_unauth_graphs_cidr is optional, but more secure.
```
$config['allow_unauth_graphs_cidr'] = array(127.0.0.1/32');  
$config['allow_unauth_graphs'] = true;
```

## Included

We include a few templates for you to use, these are specific to the type of alert rules you are creating. For example if you create a rule that would alert on BGP sessions then you can 
assign the BGP template to this rule to provide more information.

The included templates apart from the default template are:

  - BGP Sessions
  - Ports
  - Temperature
