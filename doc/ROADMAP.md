Roadmap
-------

- Device support:

    - Ruckus wireless controllers (Paul)

    - Investigate generic device support based on MIBs.  It should be
      possible to do basic graphs based just on the MIB.  They would
      obviously not be as customised as the specifically supported devices
      but should still be useful to users.

- Investigate solutions for poller performance improvement. (Tyler)

- Investigate solutions for multiple communities per device. (tooms)

- Integrate Nagios-based alerting.  Allow user to choose their preferred
  Nagios distribution/fork.

- Consider some non-monitoring functions such as enabling/disabling ports,
  changing access port VLANs, and editing port labels.
