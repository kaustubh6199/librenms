           be used for mplsFTNIndex when creating entries in the
           mplsFTNTable.

           When creating a new conceptual row (configuration
           entry) in mplsFTNTable with an SNMP SET operation the
           command generator (Network Management Application) must
           first issue a management protocol retrieval operation
           to obtain the current value of this object.

           If the command responder (agent) does not wish to allow
           creation of more entries in mplsFTNTable, possibly
           because of resource exhaustion, this object MUST return
           a value of 0.

           If a non-zero value is returned the Network Management
           Application must determine whether the value is indeed
           still unused since two Network Management Applications
           may attempt to create a row simultaneously and use the
           same value.

           If it is currently unused and the SET succeeds, the
           agent MUST change the value of this object to a
           currently unused non-zero value (according to an
           implementation specific algorithm) or zero (if no
           further row creation will be permitted).

           If the value is in use, however, the SET fails and the
           Network Management Application must then reread this
           object to obtain a new usable value."

           action to be taken on matching packets
           (mplsFTNActionPointer).

           This table supports 6-tuple matching rules based on one
           or more of source address range, destination address
           range, source port range, destination port range, IPv4
           Protocol field or IPv6 next-header field and the
           DiffServ Code Point (DSCP) to be specified.

           The action pointer points either to instance of
           mplsXCEntry in MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB when the NHLFE is a non-
           TE LSP, or to an instance of mplsTunnelEntry in the
           MPLS-TE-STD-MIB when the NHLFE is an originating TE
           tunnel."

      STATUS              current
      DESCRIPTION
          "This table contains objects which provide the
           capability to apply or map FTN rules as defined by
           entries in mplsFTNTable to specific interfaces in the
           system.  FTN rules are compared with incoming packets
           in the order in which they are applied on an interface.

           The indexing structure of mplsFTNMapTable is as
           follows.

           - mplsFTNMapIndex indicates the interface to which the
             rule is being applied.  A value of 0 represents the
             application of the rule to all interfaces.

           - mplsFTNMapPrevIndex specifies the rule on the
             interface prior to the one being applied.  A value of
             0 specifies that the rule is being inserted at the
             head of the list of rules currently applied to the
             interface.

           - mplsFTNMapCurrIndex is the index in mplsFTNTable
             corresponding to the rule being applied.

           This indexing structure makes the entries in the table
           behave like items in a linked-list.  The object
           mplsFTNMapPrevIndex in each conceptual row is a pointer
           to the previous entry that is applied to a particular
           interface.  This allows a new entry to be 'inserted' at
           an arbitrary position in a list of entries currently
           applied to an interface.  This object is self-
           adjusting, i.e., its value is automatically adjusted by
           the agent, if necessary, after an insertion or deletion
           operation.

           Using this linked-list structure, one can retrieve FTN
           entries in the order of application on a per-interface
           basis as follows:

           - To determine the first FTN entry on an interface
             with index ifIndex perform a GETNEXT retrieval
             operation on mplsFTNMapRowStatus.ifIndex.0.0; the
             returned object, if one exists, is (say)
             mplsFTNMapRowStatus.ifIndex.0.n (mplsFTNMapRowStatus
             is the first accessible columnar object in the
             conceptual row). Then the index of the first FTN
             entry applied on this interface is n.

           - To determine the FTN entry applied to an interface
             after the one indexed by n perform a GETNEXT
             retrieval operation on
             mplsFTNMapRowStatus.ifIndex.n.0.  If such an entry
             exists the returned object would be of the form
             mplsFTNMapRowStatus.ifIndex.n.m.  Then the index of
             the next FTN entry applied on this interface is m.

           - If the FTN entry indexed by n is the last entry
             applied to the interface with index ifIndex then the
             object returned would either be:

             1.mplsFTNMapRowStatus.ifIndexNext.0.k, where
               ifIndexNext is the index of the next interface in
               ifTable to which an FTN entry has been applied, in
               which case k is the index of the first FTN entry
               applied to the interface with index ifIndexNext;

             or:

             2.mplsFTNMapStorageType.firstIfIndex.0.p, if there
               are no more entries in mplsFTNMapTable, where
               firstIfIndex is the first entry in ifTable to
               which an FTN entry has been mapped.

           Use the above steps to retrieve all the applied FTN
           entries on a per-interface basis in application order.
           Note that the number of retrieval operations is the
           same as the number of applied FTN entries (i.e., the
           minimum number of GETNEXT operations needed using any
           indexing scheme).

           Agents MUST NOT allow the same FTN entry as specified
           by mplsFTNMapCurrIndex to be applied multiple times to
           the same interface.

           Agents MUST NOT allow the creation of rows in this
           table until the corresponding rows are created in the
           mplsFTNTable.

           If a row in mplsFTNTable is destroyed, the agent MUST
           destroy the corresponding entries (i.e., ones with a
           matching value of mplsFTNCurrIndex) in this table as
           well."
